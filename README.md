# etch-a-sketch

This is one of the prjects in the Foundations curriculum at The Odin Project. 

Built in the browser this is a version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. 

Creating this I will be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Todo later on! Try to add a grayscale option, which will
work as so: 
Start as light gray when hovering the grid, everytime the user hovers 
over an aldready hovered square, make it 10% darker. 
When the same square has been visited 10 times, it will be 100% black.
